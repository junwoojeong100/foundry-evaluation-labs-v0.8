# Instructor prerequisites for the English workshop

[English workshop](../README.md) · [한국어](instructor.ko.md)

**Finish with:** ready Azure services and model deployments, a complete `.env` for each team, and a rehearsed participant path, all **outside the 120-minute workshop**.

**Who:** environment owners, including self-study learners (then "instructor" means you). Participants with a complete environment go to [README step 1](../README.md#start).

**You need:** an approved subscription, model access and capacity, the [access below](#access), and a budget; preparation and rehearsal create and call paid Azure resources (model deployments, Search, logging). The [budget worksheet](#budget) prices one recorded team: about $0.54 in tokens for the main workshop and up to about $16.55 with Levels 2–3, plus hosted-agent compute and shared costs.

**Route:**

1. **Tools and access:** [install the local tools](#tools), then [check access](#access).
2. **Foundation:** if Foundry, Search, or telemetry is missing, finish [Create a dedicated environment](environment.en.md); otherwise [prepare with the existing foundation](#existing-foundation).
3. <a id="after-calibration"></a>**After judge calibration passes, choose one delivery path:**
   - **Class:** in a [rehearsal clone](#rehearsal-workspace), complete README steps 1–9. If you will teach Levels 2–3, [rehearse them](#levels). Run README step 10 in that clone, then go to the [final model check](#final-model-check) → [timing](#rehearsal) → [handoff](#handoff). After class, [clean up](#cleanup-and-maintenance).
   - **Self-study:** read [how to follow the README](../README.md#how-to-follow), then return to [`bind`](../README.md#bind-project) in the same folder.

**Start:** [install and check the local tools](#tools).

<a id="budget"></a>

<details>
<summary>Budget worksheet: what each team calls, with a sample cost</summary>

Prices vary by region and over time, so price these volumes in the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/), set a budget alert on the resource group in [Cost Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-acm-create-budgets), and compare actual cost there after rehearsal.

| Per team | Main workshop | Level 2 | Level 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent answers (each a Foundry IQ retrieval plus a candidate-model call) | 48 evaluated + 3 smoke | none | 18 (section 4) |
| Direct Sol calls | none | none | 15 stress-test answers + 6 red-team attacks |
| LLM-judge results on the auxiliary deployment | 96 + 4 calibration | 252 + one failure-clustering job | 36 rubric + 30 stress + 54 agent + 54 trace + up to 320 continuous, plus rubric and question generation |
| Safety-evaluator results | none | 36 | 15 stress + 6 red-team + 18 trace + up to 160 continuous |
| Paid objects the team creates | Hosted agent, from step 4 until step 10 cleanup | none | Continuous-evaluation schedule, for up to 8 hours or until step 10 |

The recorded English main run showed 53 agent runs and about 125.7K tokens on the agent dashboard ([recorded results](validation.en.md#dashboard)). Search, model deployments, and logging are shared and keep costing after team cleanup ([cleanup and maintenance](#cleanup-and-maintenance)).

**Sample cost from the recorded English runs:** Sweden Central list prices from the [Azure Retail Prices API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices) on September 25, 2026, GlobalStandard, before tax and discounts. Replace them with your own prices before you approve a budget.

| Per team | Main workshop | Level 2 | Level 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model and evaluation tokens | about $0.54 | about $2.32 | about $2.66, plus up to $11.03 for continuous evaluation |
| Hosted agent compute | $0.135 per active session-hour | none | same rate for the section 4 agent runs |

- Rates per 1M input/output tokens: Sol $2/$10, Luna $0.10/$0.50, Astra $10/$50, `gpt-5.4-mini` $0.75/$4.50. Safety results are priced on the AI evaluations meter at $20/$60.
- The token row adds the token usage saved with each answer, evaluation result, and the Level 2 failure-clustering job; continuous evaluation is counted at its 160-trace maximum. The red-team scan and the rubric and question generation jobs are not included because their saved results do not report tokens.
- A hosted session is billed for 1 vCPU and 2 GiB until its idle timeout ends (15 minutes by default).
- Shared costs continue: Search Basic $0.101 per hour (about $74 per month) and Log Analytics ingestion $2.99 per GB after the free allowance.

## Install and check the local tools

**This is the basic setup, even when you run commands yourself.** If you use Copilot CLI, finish these checks first and follow the [Copilot CLI guide](copilot.en.md) separately; manual runs do not need Copilot CLI, Node.js, or Playwright. The tools serve different purposes; do not reinstall ones already available.

| Tool | Why you need it | Installation reference / requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Git | Download the workshop code to your PC | [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |
| Python | Run the provided workshop scripts and agent | [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), selecting **3.13.x**; `python3.13` must work in the workshop terminal |
| Azure CLI (`az`) | Sign in to Azure and inspect/prepare resources | [Install Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) |
| azd | Run the agent locally and deploy it to Azure | [Install Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) |
| Bash | Interpret the commands you copy | [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) |
| curl | Check whether the local server is ready for requests | [curl packages for your platform](https://curl.se/download.html) |
| Editor | Read and save `.env`, results, and notes | [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or use an existing text editor |
| Browser | Complete sign-in and inspect the Foundry portal | [Install Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/download) or [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) |
| Windows only: WSL terminal | Run this guide's Linux commands on Windows | [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install) |

Run workshop commands in Bash: macOS/Linux use the local terminal; Windows uses WSL with the Linux tools installed inside WSL. Windows editors and browsers are fine for manual checks.

**Opening a terminal for the first time:** on macOS, use **Cmd+Space → search for Terminal → Enter**; on Linux, open **Terminal** from the application menu; on Windows, install WSL first, then open **Ubuntu or your installed Linux distribution** from Start. Do not paste these workshop commands into Windows PowerShell. Copy only the code block and press **Enter**; version checks can run from any folder.

**Editor — Windows/WSL users:** install the [WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) in Windows VS Code. After creating the workshop folder later, use **F1 → WSL: Connect to WSL**, then **File → Open Folder** to open it. The bottom-left **WSL** indicator confirms that the later Linux paths and terminals work in that window.

**Terminal — check CLI tools:** it stops at the first missing command; install only that tool, then repeat the check.

```bash
bash --version &&
curl --version &&
git --version &&
python3.13 --version &&
az version &&
azd version &&
azd extension list
```

**Checkpoint:** every command prints a version or JSON result, and `azd extension list` finishes successfully.

**If not:** install or repair only the missing tool, then rerun the same block. On Ubuntu/WSL: run `sudo apt-get update` once; for Bash run `sudo apt-get install bash`; for curl run `sudo apt-get install curl`.

Approve installation in your own terminal; never send the password through chat.

<details>
<summary>Platform notes for missing tools</summary>

On macOS, check `/bin/bash`, `/usr/bin/curl`, and PATH before treating a built-in command as missing. Other Linux distributions use their package manager.

</details>

**Terminal — any folder, only if `microsoft.foundry` has no installed version:**

```bash
azd extension install microsoft.foundry &&
azd extension list
```

**Checkpoint:** `azd extension list` shows an installed `microsoft.foundry` version.

**If not:** repair the azd installation, then rerun only this command.

**Terminal — verify agent commands:**

```bash
azd ai agent --help
```

**Checkpoint:** the command list includes `run` and `invoke`.

**If not:** use the version-recovery guidance below. An update notice is not itself a failure; do not run “update all” or downgrade tools mid-experiment.

<a id="tested-toolchain"></a>

**Version reference for self-study:** distinguish recorded execution from recent command checks. This is not a latest-version recommendation or a mandatory downgrade table.

| Scope and date checked | azd | `microsoft.foundry` | `azure.ai.agents` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recorded deployment and local execution, 2026-09-23 | `1.34.0` | Version not recorded | `1.0.0-beta.10` |
| Local `run` / `invoke` command availability rechecked, 2026-09-26 | `1.34.0` | `1.0.0-beta.2` | `1.0.0-beta.10` |

The `azure.ai.agents` extension handles `azd ai agent`, so compare both extensions in `azd extension list`. Do not infer the unrecorded version in the first row. The second row checks `azd version`, `azd extension list`, and `azd ai agent --help`; it is not a new end-to-end Azure rehearsal or a revalidation of the [recorded evaluation results](validation.en.md).

<a id="tool-version-recovery"></a>

<details>
<summary>If azd and the extension are installed but run/invoke are missing</summary>

Keep the outputs of `azd version`, `azd extension list`, and `azd ai agent --help`, plus the error. Class participants give them to the instructor, who compares them with **azd and both extension versions from a successful rehearsal** and repairs only the differing tool through its official installation guidance. Record these versions during rehearsal and include them in the team handoff.

For self-study, first compare your installed versions with the [version reference above](#tested-toolchain). If a command is missing, repair that tool using the [official azd installation guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd). If it remains missing, check or report a [repository issue](https://github.com/junwoojeong100/foundry-evaluation-labs-v0.8/issues) with those outputs. Do not change working tools merely because their versions differ or guess a replacement version.

**Checkpoint:** in the same terminal, `azd extension list` shows an installed `microsoft.foundry`, and `azd ai agent --help` includes both `run` and `invoke`.

**If not:** give the outputs and error to the support contact and stop here. Command availability does not prove full-workshop compatibility; the instructor still needs a rehearsal.

</details>

If you are not preparing Azure yourself, stop here and return to [README step 1](../README.md#start) or the [Copilot CLI guide](copilot.en.md). Otherwise check [access](#access), then return to **your chosen preparation path**: [new services](environment.en.md) or [existing services](#existing-foundation). Self-study does not require recreating services you already have. Install Python packages in that path's virtual-environment step, not globally here.

<details>
<summary>Reference: Azure services and conditions to prepare</summary>

</details>

<a id="access"></a>

## Access boundaries

The environment owner needs permission to create or use the workshop resources and to assign the listed roles at their target scopes. **Contributor does not grant role-assignment permission** (`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`). For self-study, first verify **subscription Owner** below. This checks resource-management and role-assignment permission, not the runner's model-inference, Search, and other data access.

**Portal — verify Owner for self-study:** in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), open **Subscriptions → your subscription → Access control (IAM) → Check access → View my access**. If role assignments appear directly instead of a `View my access` button, read that list ([official access check](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/check-access)).

**Checkpoint:** you have an active **Owner** role on that subscription. The next action depends on your preparation path.

- **New services:** return to [new-environment preparation](environment.en.md). Its commands prepare user roles on the new resources; do not manually assign roles to Search or agents that do not exist yet.
- **Existing services:** first check the runner rows below for `AZURE_EXPECTED_USERNAME`. Use **Access control (IAM) → Check access** at each scope; an authorized administrator prepares only missing access, without duplicating sufficient inherited roles. Also check the model-preparation operator row if you will deploy models. After these user-access checks, return to [existing-environment preparation](#existing-foundation). Prepare Search and agent identities separately at the steps named in the table.

**If not:** recheck the account and subscription. For an `Eligible` role, finish [role activation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-eligible-activate) first. With Contributor alone, you need an access administrator's help as described below.

An authorized access administrator must provide that permission or perform the assignments. Do not give administrator/Owner permissions to the agent as a shortcut. Participants without assignment permission need the owner for `prepare-iq` and `grant-agent-access`.

For each row, check **principal → actual role name → target resource** in that scope's **Access control (IAM) → Check access**, or give these values to the access administrator. “Runner” means the `.env` user `AZURE_EXPECTED_USERNAME`, not a managed identity.

| Principal / task | Actual role name | Exact scope | Prepare / check when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runner: resource, model-catalog, and quota discovery | Reader | `.env` subscription `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, including its `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` | Before `preflight` and each `collect`. Even with existing deployments, these commands read subscription-level regional models/usage, so group-only Reader is insufficient. Check every runner; do not duplicate sufficient inherited access. |
| Runner: project and agent work | Foundry User | Project `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_NAME` under `AZURE_AI_ACCOUNT_NAME` | New setup's `user-foundry`; check additional runners separately |
| Runner: Level 2 code-evaluator suite and Level 3 account evaluation | Foundry User | Parent Foundry account `AZURE_AI_ACCOUNT_NAME` | [Advanced evaluation access](#advanced-evaluation-access), before Level 2; project-only access is insufficient |
| Runner: model inference | Cognitive Services OpenAI User | Foundry account `AZURE_AI_ACCOUNT_NAME` | New setup's `user-model`; check additional runners separately |
| Runner: Search schema creation | Search Service Contributor | Search service `AZURE_SEARCH_NAME` | New setup's `user-search-service`; before README 2-1 |
| Runner: policy upload and retrieval | Search Index Data Contributor | The same Search service | New setup's `user-search-data`; before README 2-1 |
| Model-preparation operator: create/delete deployments | Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor | The same Foundry account | Before auxiliary/candidate preparation; not needed by participants using shared models |
| User viewing telemetry | Log Analytics Reader | Each connected Application Insights resource and Log Analytics workspace | Before portal Logs or `monitor` |
| Project managed identity | Log Analytics Reader | The same Application Insights resource and workspace, each | New setup's `project-monitor` or existing setup's `prepare-trace-access` |
| Project managed identity: scheduled evaluation and judges | Foundry User | Parent Foundry account containing the project and judge deployment | [Scheduled-evaluation access](#scheduled-evaluation-access), before Level 3 section 6; project-only Foundry User plus direct OpenAI access is not the supported substitute |
| Search managed identity | Cognitive Services User | Planner model's Foundry account | For a shared class, prepare once [before rehearsal](#shared-search-access) and retain through the class. Exclusive self-study may create it in README 2-1 `prepare-iq`. |
| Agent instance identity: retrieval | Search Index Data Reader | Workshop Search service | README 4-2 `grant-agent-access` |
| Agent instance identity: model inference | Cognitive Services OpenAI User | Candidate models' Foundry account | README 4-2 `grant-agent-access` |

New setup's `user-*` operations configure the project/model/Search roles for **one verified user**. That preparation user's subscription Owner access does not transfer to additional runners; check every user row for each runner when handing out team `.env` files. Resource creation and role assignment remain separate from these inference roles and require the owner/access-administrator arrangement above.

Check names against [Foundry/model roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/ai-machine-learning) and [Log Analytics Reader](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/monitor#log-analytics-reader). Local success does not prove hosted access. Do not duplicate sufficient existing/inherited roles or replace an older name such as Azure AI User with Owner. The agent calls models through the account endpoint, so its identity needs neither the project's `Foundry User` nor Owner. Remove roles added while diagnosing when cleaning up the test environment.

**Checkpoint:** every row has a named principal with the exact role at the exact scope, and the environment owner either can create those role assignments or has an authorized access administrator who agreed to.

**If not:** stop preparation until an authorized access administrator grants the role or performs the assignment; do not continue with Contributor-only access.

<details>
<summary>Production boundary and supported environments</summary>

This exercise uses synthetic documents shared by the team. It does not implement per-document authorization, tenant-isolated end-user retrieval, or on-behalf-of identity propagation for a production product. A Search reader role alone does not filter documents per user.

Supported hosted-agent environments are listed in the [Hosted Agent quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/quickstarts/quickstart-hosted-agent).

</details>

**Next:** with an existing foundation, continue to [Prepare with an existing foundation](#existing-foundation); for new services, return to [Create a dedicated environment](environment.en.md).

If subscription-wide Reader is not permitted, the access administrator must arrange approved read access covering both resource discovery and regional model-catalog/quota queries. See [subscription-level read access](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/quota#prerequisites). Do not borrow the instructor's account, add Owner, or skip `preflight` as a workaround.

<a id="role-recovery"></a>

### Role-assignment errors: administrator acts, then runner retries

For `AuthorizationFailed` or `roleAssignments/write`, keep the runner's folder and sign-in unchanged. The administrator uses **their own session** to verify the following principal, role, and scope and prepare only missing assignments.

| Failed command | Principal-identification information for the administrator | Role and scope to assign |
|---|---|---|
| `prepare-iq` | Object/principal ID under **Identity → System assigned** on service `AZURE_SEARCH_NAME` | **Cognitive Services User** for the Search identity on Foundry account `AZURE_AI_ACCOUNT_NAME`, not for the runner or agent |
| `grant-agent-access` | `instance_identity → principal_id` in `src/agent/.foundry/results/hosted-agent.json`, `LAB_AGENT_NAME`, and Search/Foundry resource names | **Search Index Data Reader** on `AZURE_SEARCH_NAME` and **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** on `AZURE_AI_ACCOUNT_NAME`, for that agent identity |

**Checkpoint:** the administrator confirmed the actual principal and assignments. The runner repeats only the failed command in the same account and folder; existing assignments are reused. Participant cleanup does not delete administrator-created assignments, so the administrator records their IDs and cleanup responsibility. Retain shared Search access until the entire class finishes.

**If not:** stop and give the administrator the denied operation and scope. Do not share the whole `.env` or authentication cache, or switch the runner's login to the administrator. In self-study, restore or activate your already-approved assignment permission before retrying. Do not redeploy or give the agent Owner.

<a id="existing-foundation"></a>
<a id="install-and-verify-locally"></a>

## Prepare with an existing foundation

Use this path only when the foundation services already exist. If you completed the new-environment guide, use its handoff instead; do not repeat this setup.

**If you arrived directly at this link:** finish the [tool checks](#tools) and [access checks](#access), then return here. Do not create a new environment when these services already exist.

**Order for this path:** check the scope and required service settings, pass the local tests below, then [1. settings and sign-in](#existing-settings) → [2. auxiliary deployment](#auxiliary-model) → [3. candidates and calibration](#check-candidates) → rehearsal or self-study handoff.

**Check the scope first:** the Foundry account/project, Search, and connected Application Insights must be in the configured **`AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`**, and the candidate and auxiliary models must be deployments of that Foundry account. If they are split across groups or accounts, stop and align the setup with the owner; do not move shared resources to fit the example.

<a id="existing-service-checks"></a>

**Environment owner — existing resources are not necessarily ready to use.** Check these settings first; do not change shared services without the owner's approval.

| Where to check | Required state and action if missing |
|---|---|
| Azure Portal → Search → **Settings → Identity → System assigned** | **On**, with an object/principal ID. If Off, the authorized owner selects **On → Save** and checks the ID ([official steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-how-to-managed-identities#create-a-system-managed-identity)). `prepare-iq` uses this identity but does not create it. For a shared class, the owner handles its role through [shared Search access preparation](#shared-search-access). |
| Search → **Settings → Keys** | **Role-based access control** or **Both** ([check procedure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-rbac#configure-role-based-access)). Otherwise, the owner prepares approved RBAC settings and [roles](#access); do not bypass this with a key. |
| New Foundry → your project → **Manage → Project details → Connected resources** | Exactly **one** Application Insights connection to `AZURE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_NAME` in the same group. If absent, follow the procedure below; if the later preflight reports missing `ResourceId`, use [metadata repair](#observability-repair). Stop and check with the owner if there are multiple connections or a different target. |

**Only when the observability connection is absent:** the authorized owner selects **Connected resources → Add connection → Application Insights**, chooses the **existing `AZURE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_NAME` resource**, and selects **Connect** ([official steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/observability/how-to/trace-agent-setup#use-the-project-details-connection-path)). Do not create another resource or replace an existing shared connection. `repair-observability` does not create a missing connection.

**Checkpoint:** Search identity and RBAC are ready, and the Foundry project shows the one intended Application Insights connection. The later preflight also checks its `ResourceId`.

**If not:** have the environment owner resolve the setting before continuing local preparation. Do not delegate shared-setting changes to participants or create a new foundation as a workaround.

Use an unused clone as your **model-preparation folder**.

**Terminal — start Bash:** run this in the local macOS/Linux terminal or the Windows WSL terminal. The tool check's `bash --version` does not start Bash.

```bash
bash
```

**Checkpoint:** a new input prompt appears in the same window. Keep using this Bash through the later `read -r -p` input blocks.

**If not:** check [Bash/WSL installation](#tools); do not create a new environment or sign in yet.

**Terminal — parent folder for clones:** create the model-preparation clone. If you already have an unused clone, skip this block and `cd` into its root.

**Before running:** if `foundry-evaluation-model-prep-en` already exists, replace both folder names in the block with one unused name. Do not delete the existing folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junwoojeong100/foundry-evaluation-labs-v0.8.git foundry-evaluation-model-prep-en &&
cd foundry-evaluation-model-prep-en
```

**Checkpoint:** the terminal is at the root of the new model-preparation clone, which contains `README.md` and `scripts/`.

**If not:** rerun the block with one unused folder name, or `cd` into the root of an unused clone you already have.

<a id="existing-python"></a>

**Terminal — model-preparation folder:**

```bash
python3.13 -m venv src/agent/.venv &&
source src/agent/.venv/bin/activate &&
python -m pip install -r requirements.lock.txt &&
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

**Checkpoint:** the test run ends with **`OK`**. The tests cover both languages and verify the fixed policy IDs, monetary rules, and frozen case contracts.

**If not:** use [offline-test recovery](troubleshooting.en.md#offline-tests) to distinguish environment errors from test failures before any Azure operation; keep the pinned dependencies in `requirements.lock.txt`.

<details>
<summary>Pinned package versions</summary>

Framework and Foundry SDK version ceilings can differ, so the workshop pins Agent Framework Foundry 1.11.0, core 1.16.0, OpenAI adapter 1.14.1, Azure AI Projects 2.3.0, and Agent Server Invocations 1.1.0. Do not upgrade frameworks, extensions, or SDKs indiscriminately during a workshop. The installation above uses `requirements.lock.txt`, the recorded full dependency snapshot. See [current SDK differences and migration requirements](compatibility.en.md#reproducible-runtime-versus-latest-available-sdk).

</details>

**Next:** [copy the actual settings, sign in, and name the candidates](#existing-settings).

<a id="existing-settings"></a>
<a id="1-configure-and-sign-in"></a>

### 1. Copy the actual settings, sign in, and name the candidates

**Editor — model-preparation folder:**

- If you received a complete `.env`, verify its fields against the table below; do not replace it.
- Otherwise copy `.env.example` to **`.env` at this clone's root**, then fill only the fields below.

Copy only the displayed names and endpoints: never API keys, browser URLs, `/openai/v1/`, or full Resource IDs.

| `.env` field | Where to get the value |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` / `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Azure Portal: **Subscriptions → your subscription → Overview** for the subscription ID; **Microsoft Entra ID → Overview** for its directory's tenant ID |
| `AZURE_EXPECTED_USERNAME` | The approved account's sign-in name (UPN), not its display name |
| `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` | Azure Portal: the **Resource group** containing the existing workshop services |
| `AZURE_AI_ACCOUNT_NAME` / `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_NAME` | Foundry: the selected project's **resource name / project name**. The resource is the project's parent account, not the project itself. |
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | Foundry: the selected project's **Overview → project endpoint**, ending in `/api/projects/<project>` |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | Azure Portal: the **same Foundry account → Keys and Endpoint**, using its Azure OpenAI base endpoint ending in `.openai.azure.com` |
| `AZURE_SEARCH_NAME` / `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` | Azure Portal: the intended **Search service → Overview**, copying its name and **URL** ending in `.search.windows.net` |
| `AZURE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_NAME` | Name of the **Application Insights resource connected to this project**, in the same group; not the Log Analytics workspace name |
| `MODEL_*_DEPLOYMENT` | Foundry **Build → Models**; copy actual candidate deployment names when they exist. Name missing candidates with the candidate table below. |

**Editor — language and runtime settings in the same `.env`:** explicitly set and save these three lines in this unused folder (not terminal commands). **`.env.example` defaults to `ko`, so change it to `en` here.** This is not a procedure for changing an existing run's language.

```text
LAB_LANGUAGE=en
LAB_PROMPT_VERSION=v1
LAB_AUTH_MODE=cli
```

Choose unused `LAB_PREFIX` and `LAB_AGENT_NAME` values. Record `LAB_AUX_DEPLOYMENT` later, in [step 2](#auxiliary-model). Do not paste `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` into `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`.

**Checkpoint:** the table's fields hold the names and endpoints shown in the portal, and the three lines above are saved.

**If not:** fix only `.env` before signing in.

<details>
<summary>Copilot CLI return point</summary>

If you came from the Copilot CLI guide only to collect settings, return to [plan review](copilot.en.md#plan-review) now. CLI sign-in belongs to the later execution phase.

</details>

After the local tests pass, sign in from the **model-preparation folder** so this folder uses its own isolated CLI profile. Run only the four sign-in blocks below; they match [README step 1-3](../README.md#login), but do **not** run README preflight or bind yet because the auxiliary model is not ready.

**Terminal A — 1. enter the IDs:** this keeps the sign-in in this folder's `.azure-cli/` (never share or commit it):

<a id="login-input"></a>

```bash
export AZURE_CONFIG_DIR="$PWD/.azure-cli" &&
read -r -p "AZURE_TENANT_ID value from .env: " LOGIN_TENANT_ID &&
read -r -p "AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID value from .env: " LOGIN_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

**Checkpoint:** the two prompts accepted the tenant and subscription IDs from `.env`, and the terminal stayed in the model-preparation folder.

**If not:** rerun only this ID-entry block before signing in.

**Terminal A — 2. sign in to Azure CLI:** choose the `.env` subscription if asked:

```bash
az login --tenant "$LOGIN_TENANT_ID" --subscription "$LOGIN_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" --output none
```

**Checkpoint:** Azure CLI opens sign-in if needed and returns to the prompt without error.

**If not:** retry this block with the configured tenant and subscription, then use [authentication troubleshooting](troubleshooting.en.md#login).

<a id="azd-login"></a>

**Terminal A — 3. sign in to azd** with the same account:

```bash
azd auth login --tenant-id "$LOGIN_TENANT_ID"
```

**Checkpoint:** azd login completes for the same account.

**If not:** rerun only the azd login block with the configured tenant.

<a id="login-check"></a>

**Terminal A — 4. verify both sign-ins:**

```bash
az account show --subscription "$LOGIN_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" \
  --query "{user:user.name,tenant:tenantId,subscription:id,state:state}" --output json &&
azd auth status --output json
```

**Checkpoint:** CLI `user` and azd `email` equal `AZURE_EXPECTED_USERNAME`; `tenant` and `subscription` equal the `.env` IDs; `state` is `Enabled`; `status` is `authenticated`.

**If not:** sign in again with the configured account; if no browser opens, see [authentication troubleshooting](troubleshooting.en.md#login).

<a id="candidate-names"></a>

**Editor — choose candidate deployment names before preflight:** update the three `MODEL_*_DEPLOYMENT` values in `.env` using this table.

**Runner naming requirements:** all three `MODEL_*_DEPLOYMENT` values, including existing deployments, must use **3–50 lowercase letters, digits, or hyphens and start with a lowercase letter**. When deriving new candidate names, **choose a 3–44-character `LAB_PREFIX` from the start** to fit the longest suffix, `-astra`. Do not change the prefix of a folder whose run already started.

| Candidate state | Value for its `MODEL_*_DEPLOYMENT` |
|---|---|
| The required model/version is already deployed | Copy its **actual deployment name**; it does not need your new prefix. |
| The candidate is not deployed yet | Reserve an unused name formed from your actual `LAB_PREFIX` plus `-sol`, `-luna`, or `-astra`. Step 3 creates the missing deployments. |

**Checkpoint:** each `MODEL_*_DEPLOYMENT` value meets the naming requirements and is either an actual existing deployment name or an unused `<LAB_PREFIX>-sol` / `-luna` / `-astra` name.

**If not:** do not run preflight. Correct typos to the actual names only. If an existing name is incompatible, do not merely lowercase the setting; have the owner obtain approval for the cost and scope of a compatible-name deployment with the same model/version.

Template names such as `ll-team01-sol` are not proof of an existing deployment. Keep the fixed [model IDs and versions](reference.en.md#model-names); prepare the auxiliary deployment separately below.

<a id="auxiliary-model"></a>

### 2. Prepare the auxiliary deployment first

**Before the exercise, the environment owner prepares one `gpt-5.4-mini` auxiliary deployment** that Foundry IQ planning and LLM judging share. `prepare-models` does not create it, and `--allow-missing-models` tolerates **only missing candidates**: the command still stops without this deployment. Work in order: inspect existing deployments, create one only if none matches, then record the actual name in `.env`.

**Portal — inspect existing deployments:**

1. Sign in to [Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) with the configured account.
2. In **New Foundry**, open the project matching `AZURE_AI_ACCOUNT_NAME` and `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_NAME`.
3. Open **Build → Models** and check an existing deployment against these requirements:

| Check | Fixed workshop requirement |
|---|---|
| Location | The **same Foundry account** configured in `.env` |
| Model ID / version | `gpt-5.4-mini` / `2026-03-17` |
| Deployment type | **Global Standard** (`GlobalStandard`), not a PTU reservation |
| Version stability | No automatic version upgrades (`NoAutoUpgrade`) |
| Deployment status | **`Succeeded`** |

If the **Build → Models** columns are hard to find, open the example below and compare only model, version, status, and deployment type.

<details>
<summary>Optional screenshot from the recorded Korean example (open only to locate Build → Models fields)</summary>

Use this only for field positions, not text matching. Your portal language, deployment names, prefix, and timestamps may differ. This recorded run shows **Build → Models → Deployments** with three candidate deployments plus `gpt-5.4-mini`, all `Succeeded` and `Global Standard`.

![Recorded Foundry deployments example](assets/live-ko-20260923b/screenshots/S1-P01-models-after.webp)

</details>

Reuse an existing deployment only if every row matches.

**Portal — create only if none matches:** at **Discover → Models → `gpt-5.4-mini` → Deploy → Custom settings**, create `<LAB_PREFIX>-judge` with **Global Standard**, version `2026-03-17`, `NoAutoUpgrade`, and approved capacity. Stop if model access, version/type, or quota is unavailable; do not substitute another model or modify a shared deployment.

**Checkpoint:** an existing or new auxiliary deployment matches every row above and shows `Succeeded`.

**If not:** fix model access, version or type, quota, or deployment status before editing `.env`.

**Editor — record the auxiliary deployment:** record these values in this folder's `.env`, and save the deployment's Resource ID somewhere participant cleanup does not touch.

| Key | Value to record |
|---|---|
| `LAB_AUX_DEPLOYMENT` | **Actual deployment name copied from Build → Models** |
| `LAB_AUX_MODEL` | `gpt-5.4-mini` |

**Checkpoint:** the deployment is in the `.env` Foundry account/project, meets the requirements above, and the two `.env` values match **the actual deployment name and model ID**. IQ planning and evaluation judging share this deployment, and its Resource ID is saved outside participant cleanup.

**If not:** stop here and fix the auxiliary deployment or its two `.env` values first; do not modify a shared deployment or substitute a model.

<a id="check-candidates"></a>

### 3. Check the candidates and calibrate the judge

**Terminal — check current models:** use the same model-preparation folder. The auxiliary deployment must already be ready.

```bash
python scripts/workshop.py preflight --allow-missing-models
```

**Checkpoint:** the command finishes without errors and prints `language: en` and `missing_models`. If the list is **`[]`, the candidates are ready**: skip creation and go to [judge calibration](#candidate-calibration).

**If not:** resolve auxiliary-model errors in the [previous step](#auxiliary-model), or use the [symptom table](troubleshooting.en.md#symptoms) for other errors. Do not proceed to model creation after a failed check.

**Terminal — create only if `missing_models` lists candidates:** this creates only missing, prefixed deployments and runs `preflight` at the end. New deployments use `GlobalStandard` capacity 50 and `NoAutoUpgrade`; existing deployments are preserved.

```bash
python scripts/workshop.py prepare-models
```

**Checkpoint:** the command finishes without errors and its **last JSON** has `language: en`, `deployed: true` for all three candidates, and `missing_models: []`. Do not run another separate `preflight`.

**If not:** resolve model access, quota, or deployment errors, then recover only the failed command in the same folder. Do not change names, substitute models, or create a new foundation as a workaround ([symptom table](troubleshooting.en.md#symptoms)).

<a id="candidate-calibration"></a>

**Terminal — check the judge (both paths):**

```bash
python scripts/workshop.py calibrate
```

**Checkpoint:** **`Judge calibration passed`**. README step 5 repeats this check in each participant workspace; matching completed calibration is reused. The two fixed examples are not part of the 48 candidate responses.

**If not:** [recover only calibration](troubleshooting.en.md#calibration), not completed model preparation.

<a id="observability-repair"></a>

If preflight, calibration, evaluation, or trace lookup reports missing Application Insights `ResourceId` metadata, open the owner-only recovery below before retrying.

<details>
<summary>Owner-only observability recovery</summary>

Only an authorized environment owner may repair a dedicated workshop connection; never modify a shared connection to make an example work.

If the connection itself is absent, first use [existing-service setup](#existing-service-checks). If `ResourceId` points to another resource, stop and check the intended target with the owner instead of repairing automatically.

Use `python scripts/workshop.py repair-observability --confirm` only after confirming the connection is dedicated to this workshop.

**After repair, return to the command that originally failed.**

| Failed command | Return to |
|---|---|
| `preflight` | [Candidate check](#check-candidates) for existing-environment preparation, or [README 1-4](../README.md#project-binding) for participants |
| New-environment `prepare-models` | [Environment 6-1](environment.en.md#setup-candidates) |
| `calibrate` / `evaluate` / `monitor` | [Calibration recovery](troubleshooting.en.md#calibration) / [evaluation recovery](troubleshooting.en.md#evaluation-retry) / [trace recovery](troubleshooting.en.md#telemetry), respectively |

Do not send an initial preflight failure to trace/evaluation recovery before any run exists. A local error alone does not authorize `--retry-failed`; never retry a valid low score to force a pass.

</details>

**Next:** for a class, use the [separate rehearsal folder](#rehearsal-workspace). For self-study, read [how to follow the README](../README.md#how-to-follow), then return to [`bind`](../README.md#bind-project) in this same folder. Do not repeat completed cloning, installation, sign-in, or preflight.

<a id="rehearsal-workspace"></a>
<a id="separate-rehearsal-from-participant-execution"></a>

## Separate model preparation, rehearsal, and participant execution

**For a class, keep model ownership in the preparation folder.** Do not rehearse the full exercise in that folder: its step-10 cleanup can delete the models you intend to share with participants.

<a id="shared-search-access"></a>

**Environment owner — prepare shared Search-to-planner access before the first rehearsal.** Every team uses this role; do not let a rehearsal or participant folder's `prepare-iq` create it first.

1. In Azure Portal, open **Identity → System assigned** on `AZURE_SEARCH_NAME` and identify its existing object/principal ID.
2. In **Access control (IAM)** on the planner's account `AZURE_AI_ACCOUNT_NAME`, check that Search identity's **Cognitive Services User** assignment. If missing, an authorized access administrator assigns exactly that principal, role, and account scope.
3. Keep its assignment ID, principal, and scope with the shared environment's records. Do not add it to participant ownership files or pre-create team KBs, sources, or indexes.

**Checkpoint:** shared access exists before the first rehearsal and is absent from `owned_roles` in rehearsal/team `src/agent/.foundry/local-state.json`. Teams reuse the existing assignment, so shared access survives their cleanup.

**If not:** withhold team handoff and cleanup of the affected folder. If a folder already records the shared assignment as owned, the environment owner must first reconcile its records and other teams' usage. Do not edit ownership files to make the check pass.

```text
Preparation folder (owns the shared models)
  -> copy only .env, change LAB_PREFIX/LAB_AGENT_NAME -> rehearsal clone: steps 1-9 -> optional Levels 2/3 -> step 10
  -> copy only .env, change LAB_PREFIX/LAB_AGENT_NAME -> each team's clone: same path
```

**Terminal — outside the model-preparation clone, in the parent folder for rehearsal clones:** after model preparation completes, create the default rehearsal clone.

**Before running:** if `foundry-evaluation-rehearsal-en` already exists, replace both folder names in the block with one unused name. Do not delete the existing folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junwoojeong100/foundry-evaluation-labs-v0.8.git foundry-evaluation-rehearsal-en &&
cd foundry-evaluation-rehearsal-en
```

**Checkpoint:** the terminal is at the root of the new rehearsal clone, which contains `README.md` and `scripts/`.

**If not:** rerun the block with one unused folder name, or `cd` into the root of an unused clone you already have.

**Editor — rehearsal clone `.env`:** copy **only** the model-preparation folder's completed `.env` into this clone's root. Keep `LAB_LANGUAGE=en`, the project, endpoints, and model deployment names unchanged. Change only **`LAB_PREFIX` and `LAB_AGENT_NAME`** to unused rehearsal names.

**Checkpoint:** the rehearsal clone has `.env` with `LAB_LANGUAGE=en`, the actual endpoints and deployment names, and unused `LAB_PREFIX` / `LAB_AGENT_NAME`.

**If not:** fix only `.env` in the rehearsal clone. Do not copy `.azure`, `.foundry`, authentication caches, or results.

**README — rehearsal clone:** in this clone, start at [README step 1-1](../README.md#source-setup) right after its clone block, using the `.env` you just copied, and complete README steps 1–9 in order; then return here.

**Checkpoint:** in this clone, README 9-1 `verify` shows `component_execution_verified: true`, `primary_model_outputs: 48`, and `distinct_verified_traces: 48`, and the 9-2 dashboard shows data.

**If not:** recover only in the README step that failed; do not continue to Levels or cleanup.

<details>
<summary>Bind and local-server background</summary>

`bind` uses the provided `azure.yaml` to create or reuse this folder's azd environment and set its team-specific service/agent name. It does not reprovision the Foundry project. Do not run `azd ai agent init` again, copy another folder's state, or ignore subscription/project conflicts.

Keep the local server in a trusted development environment, never expose it publicly, and stop it after the local check. Local and platform-authenticated hosted endpoints have different security boundaries.

</details>

**Next:** if you will teach Levels 2/3, continue with [Prepare Levels 2 and 3](#levels); otherwise run [README step 10](../README.md#cleanup) in this clone, then the [final model check](#final-model-check).

<a id="levels"></a>

## Prepare Levels 2 and 3

**If Level 3's prerequisites brought you here:** have the environment owner check or finish only the required preparation below, then return to [Level 3 section 1](level-3.en.md#generate-rubric). The rehearsal and cleanup path applies only to an instructor conducting a rehearsal.

Rehearse only the levels you will teach ([Level 2](level-2.en.md), [Level 3](level-3.en.md)), after README step 9 in the rehearsal clone and before its step 10. Teams do them between steps 9 and 10 in their own folders. Before teams start, confirm trace access, judge and Sol capacity, red-team approval if you teach section 3, and cleanup boundaries. **Level 2's code evaluator already needs the account evaluation API**, not only Level 3 section 4. Participants need **Foundry User** on the Foundry account; a project-scope assignment, such as the one `user-foundry` creates in the [new-environment guide](environment.en.md), is not enough.

<a id="advanced-evaluation-access"></a>

**Environment owner — before Level 2:** check the runner's Foundry User assignment on the **parent account**, not just the project. A project-only runner can complete Level 1 and register evaluators yet receive `PermissionDenied` for `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/OpenAI/evals/write` when the code-evaluator suite executes. Subscription Owner is a management role and does not replace this data-plane role.

For an existing foundation, the authorized access administrator assigns the account-scoped role from the table above. For a dedicated environment created with this guide, the verified setup user can use the optional operation below from the **original clone (`$REPO_ROOT`)**, with the original `RUN_DIR` and authorized CLI profile. It grants the role only to the user already recorded by `identity`; other participants still need their own assignments.

```bash
python scripts/provision_environment.py user-evaluation --run-dir "$RUN_DIR"
```

**Checkpoint:** `scope_resource: foundry`, the Foundry User role ID, and `created: true` or `already_assigned: true`. The assignment is recorded in the environment's infrastructure ownership state. Basic Level 1 preparation still grants Foundry User only at project scope.

**If not:** stop and check the denied principal and scope; do not give Owner to the agent or change identities. If a suite already failed, preserve `suite.json → runs → <label> → error`, allow role propagation, then retry only that failed suite run with `--retry-failed`. Do not recollect answers.

Return to [Level 2 section 1](level-2.en.md#register-evaluators), or continue the remaining trace preparation below if it is still needed.

**Terminal — prepare trace access for existing foundations:** run once in the model-preparation folder for the shared foundation. Rehearsal and team folders do not need this command after it succeeds. New environments created with [the new-environment guide](environment.en.md) already have these roles.

```bash
python scripts/workshop.py prepare-trace-access
```

**Checkpoint:** the command finishes without errors and prints `Trace access is ready. This shared preparation is not recorded as team-owned, so team cleanup keeps it.` It may also print `Log Analytics Reader is already assigned...` or `Assigned Log Analytics Reader...`.

**If not:** stop Level 2/3 preparation and have the environment owner resolve the reported managed-identity, workspace, or RBAC issue. Do not let teams start trace evaluation yet.

<a id="scheduled-evaluation-access"></a>

**Before Level 3 section 6:** the **project managed identity** needs **Foundry User on the parent Foundry account**. This is the scope required by the [official minimum assignments](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/concepts/rbac-foundry#minimum-role-assignments-to-get-started) and [hosted-agent permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agent-permissions#azure-resource-setup). It covers the Foundry project flow for evaluation assets and judge inference, including `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/AIServices/assets/read` and `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/OpenAI/deployments/chat/completions/action`.

Do not confuse this identity with the runner or hosted agent instance. **Foundry User only on the project plus Cognitive Services OpenAI User on the account was an incomplete earlier recommendation.** The latter is for direct account-level OpenAI access, not a replacement for the parent-account Foundry role. Keep the project's trace-reader permissions separately.

For an existing foundation, the access administrator assigns this account-scoped Foundry User role to the project's managed identity. For a dedicated environment created with the setup tool, run from the **original clone (`$REPO_ROOT`)**, preserving `RUN_DIR` and the authorized CLI profile:

```bash
python scripts/provision_environment.py project-evaluation --run-dir "$RUN_DIR"
```

**Checkpoint:** `scope_resource: foundry`, the Foundry User role, `principal_type: ServicePrincipal`, and `created: true` or `already_assigned: true`. The identity is read from the recorded project, not supplied as an arbitrary user or agent ID. The command does not grant Owner or remove existing assignments.

**If not:** resolve the exact identity/scope error. For `The project managed identity could not access the project` / `assets/read`, verify the parent-account scope and allow propagation before resuming the same `continuous-eval` command. Preserve its saved eval ID and creation error; do not clear ownership or grant the agent Owner. Return to [continuous evaluation](level-3.en.md#continuous-eval) after this prerequisite is met.

If a schedule exists but its judge rows show `PermissionDenied` for `chat/completions/action`, check **Foundry User on the parent account for the project identity**, not the logged-in user's access. After it propagates, wait for the next run of the same hourly schedule. Do not recreate the schedule or overwrite the first failed run to manufacture a successful first result.

Before teaching Level 3 red teaming, get organization approval for harmful-prompt testing; otherwise skip Level 3 section 3. Use only the synthetic workshop data; do not connect real employee data.

<details>
<summary>Level 2/3 rehearsal checklist</summary>

If teaching Levels 2–3, rehearse capacity, trace access, red-team approval, and cleanup boundaries.

| Check | Why |
|---|---|
| Judge capacity | Rate-limit risk → stagger teams or raise approved judge capacity. |
| Sol deployment | Shared Sol load → confirm capacity for `stress-test` and `red-team`. |
| Live agent calls | Hosted-agent load → rehearse 18 Foundry calls per team across three parallel runs. |
| Trace access | Covered by the `prepare-trace-access` command above. |
| Continuous evaluation | Scheduled judge usage → confirm up to 20 traces hourly for 8 hours per team. |
| Preview APIs | Preview API drift → rehearse custom/generated evaluators, insights, synthetic data, and red teaming close to class date. |
| Ownership | Cleanup boundary → team cleanup deletes only team-created custom evaluators and generated datasets; eval groups, insights, and red-team scans remain. |

**Trace content:** the agent's model spans record the full model input (the question with the retrieved policies) and the answer. That is what trace evaluation reads.

**Not supported here:** Agent red teaming is not supported for this hosted-agent protocol, so Level 3 red-teams the model deployment instead. See [beyond this workshop](level-3.en.md#beyond).

</details>

**Next:** after prerequisite checks only, return to [Level 3 section 1](level-3.en.md#generate-rubric). Only an instructor who finished the optional-level rehearsal runs [README step 10](../README.md#cleanup) in the rehearsal clone, then the [final model check](#final-model-check).

<a id="final-model-check"></a>

## Final model check before handoff

**Terminal — model-preparation folder:** restore its environment and check the models before handoff.

```bash
source src/agent/.venv/bin/activate &&
export AZURE_CONFIG_DIR="$PWD/.azure-cli" &&
python scripts/workshop.py preflight
```

**Checkpoint:** the command finishes without errors and shows all three candidate deployments with `missing_models: []`.

**If not:** stop handoff and return to [3. Check the candidates](#check-candidates) in this folder. Do not clean up models while teams still use them.

**Next:** [rehearsal timing](#rehearsal).

<a id="rehearsal"></a>

## Rehearsal timing

The 120 minutes assume a prepared environment. Do not shorten the workshop by omitting a model, retrieval, or evaluation. If timing slips, measure these delays: model deployment, agent deployment, cold start, RBAC propagation, evaluator completion, and telemetry ingestion.

| Time | Participant steps | Observable outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 00–10 min | 1. Prepare | Offline tests, two sign-ins, identity check, preflight, and binding |
| 10–25 min | 2. Knowledge | Actual English document IDs and IQ activity |
| 25–40 min | 3–4. Local and hosted | Real answers in both environments |
| 40–55 min | 5. Baseline | 18 actual English responses and completed Foundry evaluation |
| 55–70 min | 6. Review | A real trace and reviewed regression case |
| 70–85 min | 7. V2 | New version, same 6 dev questions × 3 models = 18 responses |
| 85–100 min | 8. Holdout | Frozen candidate and 12 responses |
| 100–110 min | 9. Observe | 48 responses, 48 traces, and complete lineage |
| 110–115 min | 10. Cleanup | Only the folder's owned objects removed |
| 115–120 min | Buffer | Evaluation and telemetry ingestion delay |

**Checkpoint:** the rehearsal fits 120 minutes without dropping retrieval, any model, evaluation, or cleanup.

**If not:** adjust capacity, concurrency, or readiness before participants start.

During class, if a team is delayed more than 10 minutes by an environment problem, restore that folder's settings and access with the team. If a different environment is needed, start a separate run with a new folder and names; do not carry over earlier responses or ownership records.

**Next:** [team handoff](#handoff).

<a id="handoff"></a>

## What to hand to each team

Use this checklist only after rehearsal cleanup, the [final model check](#final-model-check), and the [timing](#rehearsal) all pass. Participants then follow README steps 1–10; Levels 2–3 go after step 9, before cleanup.

**Editor:** designate one runner per team to use their own PC, account, and one folder; provide that runner with a complete `.env`, the README step-1 link, and the support contact. If everyone will run individually, prepare **a separate packet and unique names per runner**. Each runner performs their own sign-in and MFA.

| Item | Instructor responsibility |
|---|---|
| Account | Check the [access table's](#access) user roles and scopes for the runner's own account; put that sign-in name in `AZURE_EXPECTED_USERNAME`. Do not assume the instructor's Owner access transfers. Participants sign in and complete MFA in README step 1-3. |
| Complete `.env` | Use `.env.example`, fill the actual values, and set **`LAB_LANGUAGE=en`**. Do not include passwords, API keys, or tokens. The designated runner runs `bind` in their own folder; an instructor-bound copy does not count. |
| Ready services | Foundry project, Search, connected Application Insights, three fixed candidates, and the auxiliary deployment. Keep shared deployment names unchanged in `MODEL_*_DEPLOYMENT`; the instructor owns model and foundation costs. |
| Unused names | A unique `LAB_PREFIX` and `LAB_AGENT_NAME` **per executing folder**, with English and Korean runs in separate folders. Reserve names only; do not pre-create participant-owned KB, source, index, or agent resources. |
| Tools | Pass the [basic tool checks](#tools). Supply the successful rehearsal's `azd version` and `azd extension list` outputs; use [version recovery](#tool-version-recovery) for differences. Complete [additional Copilot CLI setup](copilot.en.md) separately if using it. |
| Access support | A person who can resolve narrowly scoped role assignment, 403, and capacity issues |
| Levels 2–3 | If teaching them, the judge and Sol capacity for all teams ([Prepare Levels 2 and 3](#levels)) |

**Checkpoint:** every row in the table is confirmed, and each team packet holds a complete `.env` with unique `LAB_PREFIX` and `LAB_AGENT_NAME`, the README step-1 link, the rehearsal's tool-version outputs, and the support contact; then send the packet and [README step 1](../README.md#start).

**If not:** withhold the team packet and fix the missing account, setting, service, name, tool, or support owner before participants start.

<a id="foundation-cleanup"></a>

## Cleanup and maintenance

**README — each owned workshop folder:** use the [README step-10 dry run](../README.md#cleanup) before confirming cleanup. Continue only when the listed names match that folder's owned objects. Never delete an entire shared resource group or run `azd down` against shared resources. Shared Search, model deployments, and logging keep costing after team cleanup; the environment owner tracks them in Cost Management.

For an **exclusive group created with the new-environment tools**, with creation records preserved in the original `RUN_DIR`, use [final foundation cleanup](environment.en.md#final-cleanup) after README step 10.

**Preserve existing groups even in self-study with existing services.** This path normally has no `RUN_DIR`. For additions such as the auxiliary deployment, use the recorded Resource IDs to agree on a separate cleanup scope, owner, and retirement date. Do not delete an unrecorded whole group to stop costs.

**Checkpoint:** each folder's README step-10 dry run lists only objects owned by that folder.

**If not:** stop cleanup and resolve the ownership or environment mismatch before confirming deletion.

**Next:** preparation and cleanup are complete. Use the maintainer checks below only when editing these guides.

<a id="documentation-checks"></a>

<details>
<summary>Maintainer checks when editing these guides</summary>

## When updating the guides

Before changing Foundry agent code or instructions, read the `microsoft-foundry` skill guidance. Use synthetic data only, do not change shared Azure resources or the default CLI subscription, and name the configured subscription in Azure commands. Keep the links between models, instructions, datasets, and traces; do not substitute models or count missing or failed rows as successes. Keep documented commands matched to the code, and pass the offline tests before any Azure run.

Keep English and Korean execution paths aligned. Lead with the outcome and starting conditions, keeping direct links for **class participants, self-study setup, and resuming an existing run** visible. Distinguish instructions (V1/V2), question sets (splits), and result names (labels) at the first evaluation step. Collapse existing-Azure preparation, tool delegation, and advanced background, but **keep beginner guidance on windows and commands, case review, and result interpretation visible in the main text**.

Explain concepts with a provided dev question, not early exposure to holdout. Each step should explain **why it is needed and what its result does not establish**, not only which command to run. Label illustrative reading exercises as neither measured results nor target scores, and match their fields, units, and denominators to the actual output. Distinguish `.env` / `.venv` / `.foundry`, models / agents / instructions, and execution completion / quality passes / production approval.

Each execution step must name **where to act, the command, its completion evidence, and the recovery path**. Give collection, evaluation, aggregation, trace lookup, verification, **candidate preparation, and calibration one command and one checkpoint each**. Recovery pages should fix the failed task, then link to **the main guide's next unexecuted command**, not duplicate a bundle of later steps. Do not repeat checks that a command already performs internally.

Distinguish states before and after recovery: an unattempted second sign-in, `init` failure before records exist, a restored V2, and a saved review that only needs reading must not share a generic rerun path. Separate early shutdown from workshop completion; never require or manufacture evidence for unfinished work.

Place each collapsed example screen right after the checkpoint it illustrates. Setup handoffs should include the shared reading instructions and target the next unexecuted command. Keep notes in one document, save it as the report after evidence and portal checks, and continue in that file for Levels 2–3. Distinguish **provenance links, execution completion, and quality passes**. Recorded answers and scores are examples, not the reader's target results. Keep actual cloud results in the separate [English](validation.en.md) and [Korean](validation.ko.md) result pages; a translated question is not a newly independent holdout case.

From the **original clone**, with its virtual environment active, run:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_docs.py' -v
```

This checks local links/anchors/assets, code-block structure, Bash/JSON syntax, Python CLI arguments against the actual parsers, and matching English/Korean command sequences. It checks that the first evaluation step's **18 + 18 + 12 responses match the actual question and model counts**, and that required result-reading guidance is not collapsed. It also checks separate checkpoints in the main, candidate-preparation, and collection-recovery paths; **If not** guidance in participant and environment-preparation guides; handoff links and shared reading instructions; the **dashboard → report → cleanup** order; the shared report file; and Monitor fields in the report. It also checks the designated class runner, explicit Bash and edition settings in existing-environment setup, and sign-in recovery returning to the original path. Input, variable restoration, and recovery branches run in isolated Bash with command doubles, not real experiment commands or Azure calls. This does not revalidate recorded cloud scores. Runnable source snapshots omit the guides and skip these documentation checks.

The checks also verify that the beginner explanation uses a real dev question, command/file guidance is not collapsed, first-response fields match the code's contract, and illustrative comparison values match the actual `summary` renderer.

Also follow [the starting instructions](../README.md#start-here) as a participant, an environment owner, and a returning user. Check that **the next action, completion signal, and next destination** require no guesswork. Automated checks cannot establish that a first-time reader understands the instructions.
